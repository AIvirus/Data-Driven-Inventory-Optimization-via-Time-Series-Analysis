# Data-Driven-Inventory-Optimization-via-Time-Series-Analysis

The goal of this project was to optimize inventory levels in service centers by leveraging time series analysis for accurate demand forecasting of spare parts. This approach helped reduce inventory costs and improve spare parts availability, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction through efficient resource management.
